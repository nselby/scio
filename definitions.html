<h2>Tap a term below to see the defintion.</h2>

<p>
<details>
  <summary>Scam Webpage or Financial Transaction</summary>
  <p>A fake website or webpage, or a social media post that offers to sell something that does not exist, or which the suspect does not own. This is also appropriate for social media impersonation - such as when someone impersonates a famous person in order to trick the victim into thinking he is giving money to a celebrity. Examples include incredibly good deals on used cars, apartments that are too good to be true (Two-bed, two-bath, hardwood floors, terrace, UWS $2300 month 1st/last/Sec); Yankees / Mets / Giants / Rangers / concert tickets, etc. Can also include Catfishing, a scam wherein a person creates a presence in social networks as a sock puppet or a fictional online persona for the purpose of luring someone into a relationship — usually a romantic one — in order to get money, gifts, or attention. Typically, the Complaining Victim will reply to the page, post, or message and be faced with a range of scams, from requests for PayPal/Venmo/Credit Card/Cash Card payment to in-person meetings for cash or checks.</p>
</details>
</p>

<p>
<details>
  <summary>Call Fraud (Government)</summary>
 <p>The first type of call fraud is that with a threat of governmental action: either arrest (“We have a warrant for your arrest, unless you pay…”); bail (“We have your grandson in jail at the 12 Precinct and you have to pay to get him released”); loss of benefits (“Your Social Security Account has been compromised and you must pay to restore benefits”) or similar scams. Victims are most typically told to buy cash cards or to make Bitcoin payments through an ATM, though all other payment methods are used as well.</p>
</details>
</p>

<p>
<details>
  <summary>Call Fraud</summary>
  <p>The second type of call fraud is simply a scam run by phone. The setup is typically the same as Call Fraud (Government) except that the penalty is a loss of service (“I'm from ConEd, your account is overdue and we will shut off your power today at 5 pm unless you pay…”). In more serious scams, a “tech support” representative will call and tell the victim that their computer is running slowly because it is infected with malware, and the suspect will request the victim grant remote access to their computer; the suspect will then gain access to the Complaining Victim's online banking and email accounts and drain funds.</p>
</details>

<p>
<details>
  <summary>Fraud E-mail / Impersonation</summary>
  <p>Emails with spoofed return addresses or return addresses that are similar to those of the Complaining Victim (e.g., ROBERT.SMITH@nypd-police.org) that purport to be the Complaining Victim's boss, co-worker, or customer, making requests that the Complaining Victim wire money on behalf of a traveling boss (“Elaine, I'm traveling today and I need to wire transfer $6,500 to Bob. Can you please make the transfer? His account is ….”); make changes to banking details (“This is ACME Vendor. We have changes our banking details. Please update your records: on ALL payments on ALL invoices, please use our new banking information…”); request the employee or family member buy gift cards (“Tina, I am traveling today and need to get some cash, can you please go to the Duane Reade at 5411 Myrtle Ave and get me $1000 in Michael Kors gift cards? You go to the front cashier and the cards are usually in a rack right there, just buy them and take photos of the back and email them to me here…”). These scams are sometimes referred to by the FBI designation Business Email Compromise, but the victim is often not a business.</p>
</details>
</p>

<p>
<details>
  <summary>Online Extortion</summary>
  <p>Online extortion can be a range of scams that prey on victims' embarrassment. Some are scams in which suspects use dating services or social media to trick a Complaining Victim into participating in a nude video chat, or expose genitals during a video chat, and then blackmail the Complaining Victim into paying to avoid release of the video. Some leverage the fact that so many data breaches have occurred that have breached passwords, and that most people reuse passwords, to scare people into paying. The scam goes something like, “Oh, you've been very bad. I've seen your online porn and wow! Your password is 827shsd. I would hate for your wife and children to see what you've been watching. To avoid me telling them….” This is extortion.</p>
</details>
</p>

<p>
<details>
  <summary>Physical Threat Extortion</summary>
  <p>Similar to Online Extortion, typically begins with contacts through social media, gaming sites, or dating sites and results in a threat of physical harm unless extortion is paid.</p>
</details>

<p>
<details>
  <summary>Account Takeover</summary>
  <p>This is not about hackers breaking into accounts, but rather to describe situations in which family members, friends, employees, or acquaintances gain access to a Complaining Victim's account credentials through access to papers, or intimate knowledge of the Complaining Victim's patterns, and access the Complaining Victim's banking or financial services accounts to transfer money.</p>
</details>
</p>

<p>
<details>
  <summary>Malware / Redirect Scam / SEO</summary>
  <p>Very similar in mechanics to the Call Fraud, Malware can force a popup on the Complaining Victim's computer or phone warning them that their device is infected. When the Complaining Victim clicks the link or calls the number, the suspects run a variant of the “tech support scam” or similar – the suspect states the victim has an infected computer (or an expired iTunes account, or an expired Microsoft license) and the suspect will request either payment via a range of methods, usually Gift or cash cards, or remote access to their computer so that the suspect will then gain access to the Complaining Victim's online banking and email accounts and drain funds.  The Redirect Scam happens with malware or misleading online ads, links, or pages that direct Complaining Victim to a site that sets the Complaining Victim up for a variant of the scam. A SEO (it stands for Search Engine Optimization) scam bases an attack on using search terms to provide fake numbers higher in Google and Bing rankings, so someone who googles “Phone slow” or “iphone support” may get a non-official number that, when called, provides a variant of the same scam.</p>

<p>
<details>
  <summary>SIM-Swap</summary>
  <p>SIM-Swap is a growing concern. Malicious actors begin by gaining access to the victim's personal information from the publicly available information or the dark web, such as address, date of birth, or Social Security number, which provides them with the opportunity to deceive wireless carriers. Malicious actors then contact mobile providers, impersonating the victim to convince the customer service provider that a mobile number needs to be transferred to a new Subscriber Identity Module, or phone SIM card. By transferring the victim's account to the suspectetrator's SIM card, the suspect takes control of the mobile number. Once the malicious actor has control of the mobile number, he/she can intercept text, email, or phone call authentication messages from banks, credit cards, and email and social media accounts.<b>Instruct the victim to immediately contact their bank, their credit card companies, their online brokerage or retirement accounts, and their mobile phone provider.</b> Tell them to report to those services that they have lost control of their mobile phone account and to block their accounts from online transactions and transfers immediately.</p>
</details>
</p>



<p>
<details>
  <summary>All other</summary>
  <p>For any cyber enabled crime category that does not fit, we use this catch-all. This can mean that it is a ind of scam that we have not thought of, or it could be a new scam type, or maybe even that you're just not sure how to categorize it. The best thing to do is note the payment methods and how the C/V was asked to transmit the money.</p>
